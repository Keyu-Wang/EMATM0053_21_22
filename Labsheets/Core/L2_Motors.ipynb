We can think of a microcontroller as a computer which interacts with the external world (any connected peripherals) through `general purpose input/output` pins (GPIO pins) - the small metal tabs or legs around the actual microchip.  We can write a program (software) to tell the microcontroller to activate a pin `HIGH`, which provides a small amount of current (typically, 25 milliamps).  However, the voltage and current provided by the microcontroller is not enough to drive (activate) the motors of the 3Pi+.  \n",

        "  - Note: `PH` and `EN` appear to have an arrow indicated into them, but the lines are not terminated against a symbol.  This means they connect to another part of the circuit, drawn elsewhere.  \n",

        "`PWM` stands for Pulse Width Modulation.  Pulse Width Modulation means turning a digital signal either `HIGH` or `LOW` (`ON` or `OFF`) within a fixed period of time, and adjusting the timing interval of the signal.

When this PWM signal is measured by the microcontroller, it is effectively averaged over time.  Therefore, a PWM with a 50% duty cycle will be measured as 2.5volts. When we instruct a microcontroller to generate PWM, we are crudely synthesising an analog signal (continuous range) from a digital signal (binary range), which is often referred to as `DAC` - digital-to-analog conversion.  The DRV8838 receives the PWM output from the 32u4 microcontroller and will effect different motor power levels.  \n",

        "The DRV8838 makes operating the motors very easy, we simply set a **`PWM`** level (power), and a **`direction`**.  The 3Pi+ is a **`differential drive`** robot from Pololu. This means it has two wheels as **`effectors`**, placed symmetrically either side of the longitude of the robot, to manoeuvre the robot.  Each wheel is driven by a motor each, the **`actuators`**.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Conveniently, most microcontrollers contain dedicated hardware to generate PWM signals - meaning it is not necessary to write our own software routine to do so.  Within the Arduino programming environment, a function called **`analogWrite()`** performs this operation (<a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/\">Arduino Reference</a>).  Writing a value of 255 creates a constant high signal (5v), whilst writing a 0 creates a constant low signal (0v).  Values between 0 and 255 generate square waveforms with a ratio of high (5v) and low (0v).  \n",

        "It is important to note that when we set a `PWM` level as input to the DRV8838, we are setting a desired output power level but **not** speed.  **Speed** (or velocity) is a measurement, and currently we do not know the real rotation of the wheel during a period of time.  Imagine, we could set an output PWM duty cycle of 100%, but the DC motor could be broken - a measured speed of 0.\n"
