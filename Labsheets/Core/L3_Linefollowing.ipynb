On the far left are infra-red `Light Emitting Diodes` (`LEDs`).  These are enabled or disabled in software.  If they are disabled, the sensor will be behaving under `ambient light` conditions - whatever IR light exists in your working environment.  The two circuit components on the right are the detecting circuits.  The general form of this circuit is repeated for the 5 ground facing sensors.  \n",

In this circuit, we can imagine that the photo-transistor is restricting the electron flow of the circuit to varying degrees depending on the light conditions.

We always expect digital logic to work in this way, and it is a characteristic which makes digital electronic circuits robust to signal noise.  \n",

        "\n",
        "This might seem unnecessarily complicated.  A reasonable question would be, \"why not use the ADC?\" or, \"why measure the time of discharge?\".  The answer is that microcontrollers typically have a small number of `ADC` **`channels`**, or pins to take analog measurements.  The 3Pi+ has been designed to use every single pin available on the 32u4 microcontroller, and so some compromises were necessary in the design.  By measuring the time taken for a capacitor discharge, a general purpose `digital pin` (normally binary, 0 or 1) can be instead be used, and yet a continuous measurement still taken (represented as time).  \n",

        "\n",
        "An important step is to validate that the example above demonstrates a working sensor operation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The above example given in `loop()` has the following assumptions you need to address in your own code:\n",
        "  - Ensure that you have completed your `setup()` routine to set the relevant `GPIO` pins into a good initial state.\n",
        "  - The example assumes that the IR LEDs were enabled (turned-on) within `setup()`.  What is the state of your IR LEDs?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Upload your code to the 3Pi+ and validate that you see a difference in the sensor reading between different surfaces.  \n",
        "  - Use the Serial Monitor and check the reported elapsed time value.\n",
        "  - Use the black vinyl tape to create a dark surface  - this will also be the surface of line your 3Pi+ will need to follow.\n",
        "  - Quickly explore different surfaces to build your intuition, examples include:\n",
        "    - a page with printed text.\n",
        "    - different colour surfaces.\n",
        "    - glossy and matte surfaces.\n",
        "    - you can <a href=\"https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0053_21_22/tree/main/PrintableSheets\">download and print</a> a grey-scale test sheet from Github.\n",
        "    \n",
        "3. Note down the smallest time reported and the largest time reported:\n",
        "  - How do these correspond to your different surfaces?\n",
        "  - How many milliseconds is the longest time reported? \n",
        "\n",
        "4. Inspect the timing values when the IR LEDs are switched off.\n",
        "  - Remember: to switch of the IR LEDs, you must set the `EMIT` pin to mode `INPUT`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use the grey-scale test sheet, or construct your own varied black-to-white surface, and record the results into the code cell below to plot a graph:\n",
        "  - how would you intepret the shape of the line, the **`sensor response`**.\n",
        "  - is your sensor consistently reliable across all surfaces?\n",

Currently, in extreme cases the sensor may take approximately 2400 microseconds (2.4milliseconds) to complete on a very black surface.  Furthermore, an ambient light measurement can exceed 5000microseconds (5millisceonds).  In both cases, millisecond durations are quite long and undesirable. \n",

If, on the other hand, the sensor is above a low-reflective surface (black tape for example), the photo-transistor will mostly be turned off, and the output voltage will be pulled towards $V_{in}$(5V in our case). \n",

        "A `class` is a way to group code together.  It helps to make writing code more efficient.  It also helps with the readability of code.  These two things together should make your code easier to debug.  At this point, you should have written a few functions and also used some global variables.  We can think of a class as way of containing these same techniques within itself.\n",

In general, when a class is used, it will help to prevent a huge number of variables and functions cluttering up the main part of your program.  When a class is created well it can be used multiple times, providing 'copies' of the same code for different problems.  You can almost think of a class as a \"mini-program\", however you must make calls to it and control its execution from your main program.\n",

        "This mechanism can be useful to vary the speed of your robot with respect to how well it is following a line.  A common issue is that a tight corner may need the robot to stop moving fowards and instead turn on the spot.  A confidence measure allows a missed tight corner to be recognised without other perceptual cues (e.g., the tight corner is not \"mapped\" or \"seen\").  Arguably, you could program your Romi to move very slowly for the entire course - however this is grossly inefficient.  Without a confidence measure, your robot might jitter on every occasion it momentarily comes off the line (i.e. not a corner).  With a confidence measure, smooth curves can be traversed with foward momentum in addition to a turning behaviour.  By including this information, your robot can afford to lose the line momentarily, and you should observe overall smoother behaviour.  \n",

We could think of this as creating a robot which quickly loses confidence (a nervous robot?).  You could start by having fixed additive (+ some amount to confidence) or multiplicitive ( multiply confidence by some amount) changes to confidence.  There is no reason not to use a combination of additive and multiplicative, if it suits your task.  \n"
