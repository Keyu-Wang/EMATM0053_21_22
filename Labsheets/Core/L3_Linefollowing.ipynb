On the far left are infra-red `Light Emitting Diodes` (`LEDs`).  These are enabled or disabled in software.  If they are disabled, the sensor will be behaving under `ambient light` conditions - whatever IR light exists in your working environment.

In this circuit, we can imagine that the photo-transistor is restricting the electron flow of the circuit to varying degrees depending on the light conditions.

We always expect digital logic to work in this way, and it is a characteristic which makes digital electronic circuits robust to signal noise.  \n",

The answer is that microcontrollers typically have a small number of `ADC` **`channels`**, or pins to take analog measurements.  The 3Pi+ has been designed to use every single pin available on the 32u4 microcontroller, and so some compromises were necessary in the design.  By measuring the time taken for a capacitor discharge, a general purpose `digital pin` (normally binary, 0 or 1) can be instead be used, and yet a continuous measurement still taken (represented as time).  \n",

        "It is important to first validate that the example above works on your 3Pi+:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The above example given in `loop()` has the following assumptions you need to address in your own code to create a working example:\n",
        "  - Ensure that you have completed your `setup()` routine to set the relevant `GPIO` pins into a good initial state.\n",
        "  - The example assumes that the IR LEDs were enabled (turned-on) within `setup()`.  What is the state of your IR LEDs?\n",
        "  - To enable the line sensor IR LEDs, does `EMIT` need to be set as an `OUTPUT` in state `HIGH`, or `LOW`?  You can check either the schematic or documentation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Upload your code to the 3Pi+ and validate that you see a difference in the sensor reading between different surfaces.  \n",
        "  - Use the Serial Monitor and check the reported elapsed time value.\n",
        "  - Use the black vinyl tape to create a dark surface  - this will also be the surface of line your 3Pi+ will need to follow (`task requirement`).\n",
        "  - Quickly explore different surfaces to build your intuition, examples include:\n",
        "    - a page with printed text.\n",
        "    - different colour surfaces.\n",
        "    - glossy and matte surfaces.\n",
        "    - you can <a href=\"https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0053_21_22/tree/main/PrintableSheets\">download and print</a> a grey-scale test sheet from Github.\n",
        "    \n",
        "3. Note down the smallest time reported and the largest time reported:\n",
        "  - How do these correspond to your different surfaces?\n",
        "  - How many milliseconds is the longest time reported? \n",
        "\n",
        "4. Inspect the timing values when the IR LEDs are switched off.\n",
        "  - Remember: to switch of the IR LEDs, you must set the `EMIT` pin to mode `INPUT`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use the grey-scale test sheet, or construct your own varied black-to-white surface, and record the results into the code cell below to plot a graph:\n",
        "  - how would you intepret the shape of the line, the **`sensor response`**.\n",
        "  - is your sensor consistently reliable across all surfaces?\n",
        "  - **help**: do not forget that you can write code to make your data collection easier for you.  Your 3Pi+ is capable of collecting multiple results and printing them in a useful format.\n",

        "The example code provided has significant room for improvement.  The below code extract is the part of the routine that waits for the `digitalRead()` measurement to go `LOW`.  Currently, in extreme cases the sensor may take approximately 2400 microseconds (2.4milliseconds) to complete on a very black surface.  Furthermore, an ambient light measurement can exceed 5000microseconds (5millisceonds).  In both cases, millisecond durations are quite long and undesirable. \n",

Arguably, you could program your Romi to move very slowly for the entire course - however this is grossly inefficient.  Without a confidence measure, your robot might jitter on every occasion it momentarily comes off the line (i.e. not a corner).  With a confidence measure, smooth curves can be traversed with foward momentum in addition to a turning behaviour.  By including this information, your robot can afford to lose the line momentarily, and you should observe overall smoother behaviour.  \n",
