On the far left are infra-red `Light Emitting Diodes` (`LEDs`).  These are enabled or disabled in software.  If they are disabled, the sensor will be behaving under `ambient light` conditions - whatever IR light exists in your working environment.  The two circuit components on the right are the detecting circuits.  The general form of this circuit is repeated for the 5 ground facing sensors.  \n",

The photo-transistor (labelled `Q10` and `Q11` above) is the **`transducer`** in the sensor, the element converting energy from one form to another - the light (photon energy) exposure attenuates the (electron energy) activation of the photo-transistor.  In this circuit, we can imagine that the photo-transistor is restricting the electron flow of the circuit to varying degrees depending on the light conditions.  It might be useful to think of a capacitor (labelled `C53` an `C54` above) as a very small battery which can be charged and discharged quickly.  \n",

Whilst the discharge of the capacitor is a continuous analog signal, a `digitalRead()` will register either `HIGH` or `LOW` depending on the voltage of the capacitor with respect to a logic threshold voltage.  We always expect digital logic to work in this way, and it is a characteristic which makes digital electronic circuits robust to signal noise.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the above illustration, we can observe how a slower discharge means more time will elapse before `digitalRead()` registers a `LOW` state.  Therefore, the exposure of the photo-transistor to IR light is determined by the `time` taken for the capacitor discharge to transition from logic `HIGH` to logic `LOW`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This might seem unnecessarily complicated.  A reasonable question would be, \"why not use the ADC?\" or, \"why measure the time of discharge?\".  The answer is that microcontrollers typically have a small number of `ADC` **`channels`**, or pins to take analog measurements.  The 3Pi+ has been designed to use every single pin available on the 32u4 microcontroller, and so some compromises were necessary in the design.  By measuring the time taken for a capacitor discharge, a general purpose `digital pin` (normally binary, 0 or 1) can be instead be used, and yet a continuous measurement still taken (represented as time).  \n",

A common issue is that a tight corner may need the robot to stop moving fowards and instead turn on the spot.  A confidence measure allows a missed tight corner to be recognised without other perceptual cues (e.g., the tight corner is not \"mapped\" or \"seen\").  Arguably, you could program your Romi to move very slowly for the entire course - however this is grossly inefficient.  Without a confidence measure, your robot might jitter on every occasion it momentarily comes off the line (i.e. not a corner).  With a confidence measure, smooth curves can be traversed with foward momentum in addition to a turning behaviour.  By including this information, your robot can afford to lose the line momentarily, and you should observe overall smoother behaviour.  \n",

There is no reason not to use a combination of additive and multiplicative, if it suits your task.  \n"
