We have used the assumption that an encoder `interrupt service routine` (ISR) will activate when the wheel is moved.  This is achieved on the 3Pi+ by using a **`Pin Change Interrupt`**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**`Pin Change Interrupts`** are a special piece of hardware.  Microcontrollers have many useful built-in peripherals.  A pin change interrupt watches a specific pin on the chip for a change of state (low to high, or high to low).  When the microcontroller detects a change, it can be set to automatically run a piece of code.  The piece of code which runs automatically is called an **`Interrupt Service Routine`** (ISR).  An ISR is not exclusively for pin changes - they can be triggered to run by many peripherals, taking input internal or external to the microcontroller.  \n",
        "\n",
        "An `interrupt` is so called because it will stop (pause) sequence of your main code.  These are especially useful to catch external events, rather than `polling` to detect them.  However, most microcontrollers have only one central processing unit (CPU, often called a 'core').  Therefore, because your code within `loop()` runs on the only CPU inside the 32u4, it will be paused to run an ISR instead.  \n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of an ISR as being a background task which runs \"only when it needs to\".  However, you are responsible for determining the cause of the interrupt (what triggers it), and the efficiency of the ISR (how much CPU time it will use).  \n",

        "If you are experimenting with an ISR and your robot starts to behave in a strange way, you may have made your ISR too big (or more seriously, have a bug within the ISR code).  Note that, using ISR's means the execution of your code is no longer `deterministic` - the compiler cannot predict when an ISR will activate, and neither can you.  For example, we cannot know when a wheel and motor will rotate.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, a Pin Change Interrupt is very convenient for watching the state of the encoders.  We can consider catching encoder changes to be a high priority, perhaps higher than our main program.  For example, if we miss encoder changes, we will lose track of our robot position.  \n",

        "The designers of 3Pi+ decided to use some electronics to use just 1 pin per encoder to trigger a pin change interrupt - using just one pin to register a change for either pins to an encoder.  They have achieved this by using an electronic XOR (eXclusive OR) logic gate across the A and B channels, one XOR for each encoder.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that the signals for A and B are always out of phase by 90&deg;.  Therefore, by XOR'ing A with B, we can register when a change occurs to either A or B through just one pin (it will always be exclusively one or the other that changed).  \n",

The higher the CPR, the more precisely  rotation can be determined. This is because we are essentially dividing a full rotation (360 degrees, or 2\\*PI radians) by the CPR.  One thing that will effect this, is whether the encoder is placed before or after any gearing on the motor.  It may be that a full rotation of the encoder is only a fraction of a full rotation of the wheel.  This is the case for your Romi.  Your Romi has a 120:1 gearbox.  \n",
