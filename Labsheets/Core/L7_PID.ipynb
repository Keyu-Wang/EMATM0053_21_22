For our small robot, rapid changes to wheel speed are likely to cause the wheels to slip on the surface.  From the last labsheet, we have been using the rotation of the wheels to estimate the robots `pose` (position and rotation).  Therefore, if the wheels slip on the surface, there will be encoder counts but the robot will not change it's `pose` in reality.  Within the line following challenge, wheel slip will severely effect the ability for your robot to complete the final objective, `return to home`.  \n",
