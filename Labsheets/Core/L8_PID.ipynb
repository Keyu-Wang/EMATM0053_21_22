For our small robot, rapid changes to wheel speed are likely to cause the wheels to slip on the surface.  From the last labsheet, we have been using the rotation of the wheels to estimate the robots `pose` (position and rotation).  Therefore, if the wheels slip on the surface, there will be encoder counts but the robot will not change it's `pose` in reality.  Within the line following challenge, wheel slip will severely effect the ability for your robot to complete the final objective, `return to home`.  \n",

Therefore, it is desirable for our heading to change in a continuous manner (not sudden), just as it is desirable for wheel speed to change in a continuous manner.  \n",

        "- the **output** would be a heating element, to effect the temperature of the room.\n",
        "- the **demand** input would be the user temperature control on the wall.\n",

        "Therefore the operation of a PID controller can be described in natural language as:\n",
        "- **measuring** the temperature of the room\n",
        "- attempting to match the measurement to the user **demand** (e.g., what is the difference, the **error**)\n",
        "- adjusting the **output** heating element _appropriately_ to be hotter or cooler, to raise or lower the temperature of the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that the measurement, output and demand can each be of different units and of different scales:\n",
        "- The user demand might be in Celcius in 1 degree increments in the range [5 : 30].\n",
        "- The measurement might be a 12-bit digital value from a linear temperature sensor\n",
        "- The output might be a high electical-current to drive a non-linear industrial heater working in kilo-Watts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, a PID controller must map a **relationship** between demand, output and measurement (e.g., room gets too hot -> heater must get cooler).  Furthermore, there is a necessary **transformation** that must occur between:\n",
        "- making a comparison between measurement and demand to determine the **error signal**\n",
        "- transforming the error signal to correct the **output**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the above example of maintaining the temperature of a room, we would need to transform a **small error signal** (between a temperature sensor and user demand), to a **large voltage** for a kilo-Watt heater.  For controlling the motor on the Romi, we start with an **encoder count** (`unsigned long`), and we must transform this into an **analogWrite()** (`[0:255]`).  Every system will:\n",

        "\n",
        "The advantage of being 'unit agnostic' (different units on input and output) is that a PID controller can be used to provide closed-loop control between any input signal and output signal, so long as their is a strong causal relationship.  Therefore, you may later use another PID controller to minimise the error of other system state variables.  It is likely that you will use the output of one PID controller as the demand signal for another PID controller (called, nested control).\n",
        "\n",
        "Whilst it is good that a PID controller can be 'unit agnostic', there is a clear drawback.  Every PID controller requires careful implementation and calibration.  PID controllers have a reputation for being annoying to work with because there are plenty of parts to go wrong.  When they go wrong, they tend to oscillate or exhibit chaotic, hard to understand behaviour.  Therefore, it is important to only take small steps and make small changes.  It is important to approach implementing a PID controller in a methodical way - a way which builds up complexity and removes as many errors and oversights as possible.\n",

        "### Step 2: Tuning your PID\n",
        "\n",
        "A PID controller is going to take your **error signal** and transform it into a meaningful **output signal** to drive your system.  To create this transformation, a PID controller must be **calibrated**, or **tuned**.   You may find tuning a PID controller difficult.  You should find a lecture to help guide you in this process.  You may arrive at a controller which does not use all terms (P, I and D) - such as a PD controller, or just a P controller - it depends on your task requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "The transformation of error signal to output signal is created by setting the **P, I and D gains**.  It is best to work with one gain at a time.  Simply put:\n",
        "- **P-gain** multiplies (or divides) the error signal to produce the output signal, and it is the first gain you should set.  It is the most straight forward mapping of error signal to output signal.  \n",
        "    - You can think  of the P-Gain as an aggressive response (a shunt) to try to \"jump\" the output signal to correct for error.  When the error decreases, so will the effect of the P-Gain.  If the error is 0, your P-Gain will multiple out to 0 as well.  Therefore, P-Gain has less influence on your system in low-error conditions.\n",
        "    - It is unlikely that you will find a perfect p-gain value.  Generally, it is better for your system to undershoot, rather than overshoot.  \n",
        "        - Overshoot can quickly become oscillation.  Trying to fix this with D-Gain will only create worse oscillations.  \n",
        "        - Undershoot results in a steady state error, which can be fixed with I-Gain.\n",
        "- **D-gain** compensates the P-gain, by producing an effect based on the rate-of-change.  You may notice your P-gain causes overshoot, and the D-gain can help to counteract this.\n",
        "    - You can think of the P-Gain as acting like a dampening spring which resists sudden movement.\n",
        "    - Don't use D-Gain to try to fix persistent oscillation, this is not it's purpose.  It will only cause more oscillation.\n",
        "    - Only use D-Gain to attempt to \"smooth\" the response of your system under significant changes in the demand.\n",
        "- **I-gain** adds to the output signal when an error signal is sustained over time.  It effectively 'accumulates' error if the target has not been reached quickly enough.  The I-gain is normally the most sensitive, and therefore has a very small gain-value.  It is best to experiment with the I-gain last.  \n",
        "    - You can think of the I-Gain as a gentle persistent force to correct for an error signal that has not been fixed by the P-Gain.  \n",

        "    - Think about this question carefully, sketch down some graphs you'd expect to see.\n",
        "    - Make sure you understand what a given error signal should be transformed into (by a gain value) to produce a useful output signal.\n",
        "        - For example, if you observe your error signal on the Serial Monitor (or plotter), work out what P-Gain value would produce a useful output (analogWrite needs a value between 0 : 255 ).\n",
        "    - Make sure you report useful information back using `Serial.print()`, and make sure you can understand what you are observing.\n",
        "    - Work with one gain at a time, and make sure the relationship is as you would expect.\n",
